# X Education Lead Conversion Prediction Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome to the X Education Lead Conversion Prediction Case Study. In this project, we collaborate with X Education, an online courses provider, to boost their lead conversion process. Despite attracting many potential customers, their conversion rate remains low. Our mission is to create a predictive model that assigns lead scores, identifying leads with the highest likelihood of conversion. The ultimate goal is to elevate their conversion rate to approximately 80%.

## Lead Conversion Process

X Education attracts industry professionals through diverse marketing channels, guiding them to explore their courses on the website. Prospective customers engage by filling out forms and interacting with content. When a form is completed with contact details, a lead is generated. The sales team then reaches out through calls and emails, aiming to convert these leads into paying customers. Typically, only around 30% of leads convert.

## Objectives

Our primary objectives for this case study include:

1. Developing a logistic regression model to assign lead scores ranging from 0 to 100, indicating the probability of conversion.
2. Tackling additional challenges set by the company, ensuring the model's adaptability to future changes.
3. Providing insightful solutions and recommendations based on the logistic regression analysis.
4. Creating a comprehensive presentation summarizing our approach and findings, tailored for the chief data scientist's review.

## Data and Methodology

### Data
The dataset comprises approximately 9000 data points and encompasses attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable 'Converted' signifies whether a lead converted (1) or not (0). Some categorical variables contain a level 'Select,' treated as a null value.

### Methodology
Our methodology encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and addressing categorical variables.
3. **Model Building**: Creating a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion probabilities.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics.

## Results and Recommendations

Our comprehensive deliverables include:

1. A thoroughly commented Jupyter notebook featuring the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and performance metrics.
2. A Word document addressing the company's concerns, offering solutions grounded in the model's outcomes.
3. An engaging presentation incorporating technical insights and business implications for the chief data scientist's review.
4. A concise 500-word summary report, documenting our approach, challenges, and key learnings from the assignment.

## Summary and Learning

The X Education Lead Conversion Prediction Case Study equips us with valuable insights into addressing real-world business challenges using data science techniques. Through this project, we enhance X Education's lead conversion process and work towards achieving their ambitious conversion rate target.

## Submission Components

1. Python commented file (Jupyter notebook)
2. Word document addressing company problems and solutions
3. Presentation summarizing analysis for the chief data scientist (PDF format)
4. Summary report in PDF format, highlighting the assignment process and learnings

We look forward to presenting our findings and contributing to the growth of X Education.
